Brain Tumor segmentation is one of the most crucial and arduous tasks in the terrain of medical image processing as a human-assisted manual classification can result in inaccurate prediction and diagnosis. Moreover, it is an aggravating task when there is a large amount of data present to be assisted. Brain tumors have high diversity in appearance and there is a similarity between tumor and normal tissues and thus the extraction of tumor regions from images becomes unyielding. In this paper, we proposed a method to extract brain tumor from 2D Magnetic Resonance brain Images (MRI) by Fuzzy C-Means clustering algorithm which was followed by traditional classifiers and convolutional neural network.
